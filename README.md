* Score: 8.5 (8.5 for whole course)
* Contribution (group of 4): mainly worked on bibliometrics part and interviewed one Prof.
* Report: unable to show due to the potential privacy issue
### Experimental Design and Data Analysis
Many homeworks, I had bad feeling about this course. It proves that math is broing for me.

So, no detial.

8.0 in the end, thanks to Azim and Saliha

Contribution is few.
